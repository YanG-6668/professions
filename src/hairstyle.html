          <h3>My work</h3>
          <p>
            My career in hairdressing began as a teenager in Essex where I started cutting the hair of my friends
            and family in my mumâ€™s living room. I loved that I was able to help others feel more confident
            by creating tailored styles designed specifically to enhance their features and personality.
            I knew that this was absolutely my passion and from that point on made it my mission to learn everything
            there was to know about cutting techniques.
