          <h3>My story</h3>
          <p>
            John Savos, born on the 15th of January 1980, is a Spanish chef who is internationally recognised for his cooking and famous restaurants.
            He currently has three Michelin stars. His passion for cooking started when he was a child and his parents didn't let him play basketball due his short height (4 feet)
            so instead they used to take him frequently to the famous Madrid restaurant Viridiana.
            He soon became fascinated by the owner, Abraham García, a chef whose cooking reflects many of his personal interests,
            including literature, photography, minery, travel and art. These visits to the famous restaurant led David to go to catering college,
            where he began his further academic training. He combined combined his nursery studies with gaining experience (he never gained height though)
            by working in Spain and abroad, where he had the chance to develop further experience. His work led him to live in London, working in top restaurants
            such as Nobu or Hakkasan restaurant (Asian restaurants). He spent nearly two years at each.

          <h3>My work</h3>
          <h4>DiverXO</h4>
          <p>Back in Madrid, David decided to open his own business, but never imagined that it would become a temple of gourmet pilgrimage:
            DiverXO. He serves three tasting menus, according to how much time the customer has on their hands, attracting people who are always willing to find,
            experiment and try out new culinary sensations: a fusion of Mediterranean and Chinese cooking with brushstrokes of Japanese.
          </p>
          <h4>StreetXO</h4>
          <p>
              Originally opened in 2012, StreetXO is Muñoz’s more casual and affordable restaurant. Recently relocated at El Corte Ingles’s Gourmet Experience on Serrano 52,
            the restaurant includes exciting decor, delicious cocktails, and intriguing food.
            Apparently, the decor and the food are supposed conjure up a wet market in Hong Kong or a food alley in Singapore.
            Upturned crates serve as bar stools and neon signs line the walls.
            London’s StreetXO is a direct offshoot of Madrid’s, with similar decor and at least half the menu being identical, fusing Asian and Spanish cuisine.
            Unlike virtually every other restaurant in London at the moment there is nothing remotely rustic, authentic, minimal or industrial at play, which is refreshing.
            StreetXO london is David´s first restaurant abroad. Dishes arrive one after the other, tapas style,
            handed to you across the bar by the chefs as if they were street food. There are no waiters.
            Visually, the food matches the atmosphere and the deep red décor. It also chimes with the Spanish fiesta spirit of the restaurant.
