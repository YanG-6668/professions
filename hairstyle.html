I loved that I was able to help others feel more confident by creating tailored styles designed specifically to enhance their features and personality. I knew that this was absolutely my passion and from that point on made it my mission to learn everything there was to know about cutting techniques. </p> </div> <div class="person__work-gallery"> <img src="barber-gallery-1.38c66a99.jpg" alt=""> <img src="barber-gallery-2.51f15fe7.jpg" alt=""> <img src="barber-gallery-3.36f3f691.jpg" alt=""> <img src="barber-gallery-4.15069720.jpg" alt=""> <img src="barber-gallery-5.a44cc705.jpg" alt=""> <img src="barber-gallery-6.a26ff8d6.jpg" alt=""> </div> </div> </main> </body></html>
