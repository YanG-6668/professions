Eventually, Elena Morell was able to graduate high school in Munich, where she would work as a circus magician's assistant for three years. At the age of twenty while walking down the street, Elena Morell was asked by a photographer if she ever thought about having a modeling career. Elena Morell decided to give modeling a chance and moved to Paris where she had a successful modeling career for ten years. However, Elena Morell felt that as a model, she did not have the freedom to decide where her or how image would be used </p> <p> Her boyfriend at the time gave her a camera, leading to an impromptu photo shoot in Africa by her of her model colleagues.
